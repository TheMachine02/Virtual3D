-find a way to supress zero length span. If on the first triangle half, skip it, no writing in edge buffer, advance normally
If on second triangle half, STOP it. Exact same behaviour for u/v interpolation
-Use edge tracing to get gradient information rather than compute it
-faster loop for tracing edge / uv edge. Maybe push data rather than ld (ix), reg ; combine both edge tracing & put always RIGHT, output width as adress to jump buffer.

So, compute edge, edge have adress in VRAM. How retrieve directly jump table ?

add hl,de \ add hl,hl \ add hl,hl method

Secondly, copy some edge tracing loop to sha256 ?


GPR0 should be V
GPR1 should be U

that way, gpr0 is interpolated in the non exx area
gpr1 is interpolated on the shadow reg
